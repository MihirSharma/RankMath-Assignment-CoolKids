# COOL KIDS Project - RANKMATH TEST

## by Mihir Sharma

## The problem

According to the user story, we need to develop a user management and data system with full Create and Read functionality for the users and Read and Update functionality for the Maintainers.
The Maintainer can access the user data through email or first and last names;
The users have 3 possible roles:

1. coolkid - A basic user with access to their own data
2. coolerkid - An elevated user with access to limited data of all users
3. coolestkid - An elevated user with access to all user data (non-maintainer)

The maintainer - A superuser with the ability to elevate other users.
